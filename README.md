# Context 
The process of looking for jobs (applying) as well as looking for candidates suitable for a particular job (recruiting) is now almost entirely done online. 
This creates opportunities, but also challenges - it becomes necessary to explore the enormous amount of data generated by both processes.

We are working for a company that owns a job portal and has many job postings from other companies who wanna hire candidates. An important stakeholder asks for insights regarding data jobs, especially data scientists, data analysts and business intelligence jobs. Your task is to do analysis on these data and feedback insights to the business. 

# Goal
Employ Word2Vec on job postings to get get the skills that are most associated with the job roles of data scientists, data analysts and business analysts

# Skills/Methods
- Apply basic NLP preprocessing steps that essential for processing data in Word2Vec using spacy and Phraser by gesim 
  - Lemmatize words
  - Remove stop words
  - Remove non alphabetic characters
  - decapitalize all the words
- Add Bigrams using Phraser by gensim basically to get connected words like "data_scientist" or "data_analyst" 
- Use scikit-learn Pipelines 
- Use GridSearch in combination with cross validation for model tuning
- Implementation with scikit-learn
- Deploy classification performance metrics for classification task
- explore feature selection techniques and dimensionality reduction with PCA
- first deployment wit streamlit  

## Basic Steps in this Project: 
1. Explore & clean the data 
2. Apply basic NLP preprocessing steps that essential for processing data in Word2Vec using spacy and Phraser by gesim 
  - Lemmatize the tokens to reduce the different forms of a word to one single form (Example: reducing "builds", "building",or "built" to the lemma "build")
  - Remove stop words / common words that have mainly relational meaning (Example: “a”, “there”, “is”, “are” “really”, “nothing”, “towards” etc.)
  - Remove non alphabetic characters
  - decapitalize all the words
3. Use Bigrams: Mainly to combine separate words like “data” and “scientist” to “data_scientist” or “data_analyst”, “machine_learning” etc.  
4. Train and apply the model
5. Put together a list of skills for each data role manuall and only keep the most similat words that are contained in this list 
6. Explore the results

## Most relevant results:

*Here we see the a first result of word2vec: the ten most similar words for data_analyst and data_scientist in one graph.   
Note: we still have to filter out only the skills*

*Here we see the most relevant skills for data_scientists: Their similarity scores tell us which of the skills are mostly associated with the job role*

*Here we see the most relevant skills for data_analysts: Their similarity scores tell us which of the skills are mostly associated with the job role*

We see some similarities in the skillsets between data scientists and analysts but also important differences.   
Skills like reporting, seo and data mining come more into fore when looking at data analysts compared to data science roles.

*A completely different skillset is asked for busines analysts*

For business analysts the skill to handle specific analytic tools like SAP and specific soft skills like project management and scrum master skills become important.
